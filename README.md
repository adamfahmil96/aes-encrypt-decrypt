# AES Encrypt/Decrypt

My personal repository for Encrypt/Decrypt using AES algorithm. For now, I use two languages: Python and JavaScript.

## Installation

First, we have to install the packages.

### Python

```python
python -m venv env
pip install requirement.txt
```

### JavaScript (NodeJS)

```
npm install
```

## Usage

For Python, enter the virtual environment first, then run python file

```python
python <file_name.py>
```

For JavaScript, because of using NodeJS, just register your command to package.json then run:

```
npm run start
```
